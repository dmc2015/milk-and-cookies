Computer Science
================

Learning Objectives
-------------------

- Define "algorithm"
- Identify what Big-O time-complexity measures
- Give an example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm
- Predict the time-complexity of a given algorithm
- Describe a few basic data structures by listing three traits of each
- Identify the time-complexity of search for a particular data structure

Algorithms
----------

- Strategy
- Steps for problem solving
- Examples
- Writing an algorithm in English exercise

Big-O (Asymptotic Analysis)
---------------------------

- Naive number guessing
- Divide-and-conquer number guessing
- Big-O table
- Demonstrate number guessing, diagram as flow chart
- Give an algorithm, ask students to predict Big-O

Data Structures
---------------

- Lists (Primitive Arrays, Stacks, Queues)
- Linked Lists (bonus doubly-linked list)
- Hash
- Tree
- Research Activity
- Characterize search method for each (bonus: other methods like insertion, deletion)
